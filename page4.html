<p>I decide to take the deflated balloon dog and use it as a parachute-type glider. The wind begins to pick up and I hope for the best. To my surprise, it works! Video game magic!</p>

<p>I glide over the “stream” and land on the ground. Two more streams to go. I begin to run, glide and land. Run, glide, land. I’ve made it. In the distance I can see a little shack, I hope the old lady can be found inside. </p>

<p>I run to the shack and it’s exactly what you expect.  A cozy grandma-style build, there is smoke coming from the chimney and a pie in the window. I approach the door just as I hear an unwelcoming sound. I’m not sure what to do. I know the quest is to interact with the old lady, so ultimately I have to, but the sound coming from inside the shack is not something I am prepared to deal with. Just as things start to get freaky, it begins to rain. Not just rain, it begins to downpour, thunder, lightning, and winds that could carry you for miles. </p>

<p>I’m beginning to get soaked which in turn makes me get extremely cold. I slowly start creeping to the window where the pie is placed to see if I can get a look inside. As I get up to the window, I can see inside, THE OLD LADY! Just as a smile starts to come across my face, another NPC appears. The NPC is grunting and breathing heavily, this is exactly what the noise was. I’m not sure what’s going on but I feel the urge to take this as a hero situation and get in there to save the old lady. I’m sobbing wet at this point so I know I can’t get in quietly. I can burst through the front door and equip my glass bottle of non-trademarked soda as a weapon or I can take the pie from the window, throw it at the NPC, and run out the door with the old lady.</p>
