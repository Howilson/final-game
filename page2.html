    I decided to take the saddle and the glass bottle of non-trademarked soda. I figure the saddle can be equipped for one of those giant balloon animals out there, and I’m sure to get thirsty at some point. After making my decision, I lay down in my bed to rest. 

In the morning I get out of bed and walk out the front door. As I walk out the door, I see the unnamed NPC, I approach her hoping for further instructions. 

“Goodmorning! I see you have selected Option 1! Great choice, remember there are no takebacks! What you have is what you get! Along with the saddle and drink, you have accepted Quest number 1. In this quest use your belongings to make your way through the valley on the other side of town. In the valley, there will be many trees, streams, and butterflies, be sure to soak in the views! While enjoying the valley be on the lookout for an old woman, she will give you further instructions. GLHF”

I’m happy with my decision, all I have to do is stroll through the beautiful valley, hopefully on one of these cool balloon animals. I decide to go with the classic blue dog and as expected, I saddle up and begin to ride. 

As I ride through the valley it's as beautiful as anticipated. I take in all the views, the flowers, the trees in the distance, and the beautifully green warm grass. I’ve been riding now for miles and the heat of the day is beginning to get me sweaty. I see a nearby stream and decide that will be a great opportunity to cool off. 

The stream is much wider than expected but I figure there’s a reason I’ve coded the game to include balloon animals. After a quick rest, I remember the non-trademarked soda  I have in my inventory, so I equip that into my hand. The cap is stuck and I’m trying my best to get it open. All of a sudden the cap loosens and flies off the bottle. To my misfortune, the sharp bottle cap pierces my balloon dog. I watch my method of transportation deflate. 

I quickly begin to panic, I can see the depth of what I expected to be a stream be a full-on bottomless body of water. I have no idea how to swim in this game because of course, swimming mechanics in every game is so different and difficult. I have no idea what to do at this time, I know I can’t go back to the town, there's nothing there for me, but I don’t think I can swim either. I look around and see what my other options are.
