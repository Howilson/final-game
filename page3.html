<p>I decided to take the sword and the Saylor Twift CD. I figure the sword will be useful if I get into any danger, and at the very least maybe I can pawn the CD off to another NPC for something better. After making my decision, I lay down in my bed to rest. </p>

<p>In the morning I get out of bed and equip my sword. As I walk out the door suddenly I begin to lag. *GLITCH* The sword is no longer in my hands. I run inside, it's not in the chest either. I see the unnamed NPC standing outside my door, maybe she has it. I approach her. </p>

<p>“Goodmorning! I see you have selected Option 2! Great choice, remember there are no takebacks! What you have is what you get! Along with the sword and CD, you have accepted Quest number 2. In this quest use your belongings to trek through the woods behind your house. You will need to find a box, and inside the box will be instructions on what to do next. Beware, there will be obstacles waiting for you so be alert! GLHF”</p>

<p>She stops talking, I still don’t have my sword! I approach her again as she walks away, same dialogue. Great. My laziness is screwing me right now, all I have is a rip-off CD and a quest through the woods, and I’m sure nothing good is going to come of this. But I guess I don’t have anything else to do today. </p>

<p>I begin heading toward the woods behind my house, leaving the colorful town behind. I can already tell it’s very dark in here, I’m sure I’m in for some trouble. </p>

<p>As I’m walking through the woods I’m sure to dodge anything that looks dangerous. All of the sudden a half-bear starts running at me, I begin to sprint, again not for long. I don’t know what to do to protect myself. I mean, what even happens when you’re trapped inside your half-finished video game and you die? I don’t want to know. I quickly think of all the things I can do to protect myself. </p>
