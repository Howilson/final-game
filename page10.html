    I grab the pie from the window and head to the door. I’m not entirely sure about this plan but I don’t see much else working either. I slowly open the door but the wind slams it shut immediately. I can’t see inside anymore so I’m not sure what’s going to happen next. My best bet is to stay at the door until someone comes over to it. 

I wait a few minutes, still getting soaked before I realize that this is a game and the NPC will not be randomly coming to check the door like in the movies. I open the door again and walk inside. As soon as I know I am within POV of the NPC I run at them, pie in hand, slam it in their face, grab the old lady, and RUN. 

Once back outside in the freezing rain, I begin to talk to the old lady. 

“Congratulations on finding me. I have been waiting for you to save me. I’m sure glad you knew to grab that pie as a defense, he’s allergic to pumpkin! Now that you have gotten me out of the house I can give you instructions on where we need to go next.”

Awesome,  I completed the first quest! I interact with her to get further information.

WHAT? That’s it? It can’t be???
