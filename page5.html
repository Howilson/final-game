    I decide to play dead in hopes it’s a brown bear coming my way, it’s dark enough that I can’t tell. As I lay on the ground hoping to stay alive, I hear the footsteps nearing me. I open one eye, and there it is right in front of me, the ass-half of a brown bear. I get up trying not to laugh. This time, my laziness pays off. As I look at the ass of this bear, I think to myself this game might be easier to get through than I thought.
