    I open the left box. Inside is a CD player, I hope this is the right decision. I whip out the Saylor Twift CD and quickly put it in the player. The music starts playing and the bear stops. A pop-up appears. 

Congratulations. You choose the right box! Well the left box, but the correct one! You belong with this quest. It’s like the fate of Romeo and Juliet’s Lovestory. That bear Knew You were Trouble when it started chasing you. And now it's Midnight so you probably want to get out of this Lavender Haze woods and back to December, the next town over that holds your next quest. 

Man, I had it bad for TSwift in the real world. But nonetheless, I’m safe, I’ve heard some track titles, and I’m ready to get going on the next quest.
