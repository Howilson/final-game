    I had been developing this adventure game over the last year, but I never had the time to finish it. I just couldn’t figure out how to continue the storyline. Now here I am, stuck in the very thing that had been taking over my life, now quite literally.

    I begin walking through the town, looking at the people, although they don’t look much like people at all. Everyone just looks like giant balloon animals.  Out of the corner of my eye, I catch a glimpse of an NPC. I begin running towards them, but I quickly run out of sprint, fucking Fortnite code. When I finally approach the unnamed NPC she greets me.
    
      “Hello there. Welcome to ________! We’ve been patiently waiting for you to arrive. Along the road you will find a glowing house, this is yours to rest your head on tonight. Inside the house you will find a chest full of things but beware, you may only take two items from the chest, the rest will then disappear. The items you take will determine the quest you will be set on in the morning. GLHF (Good luck have fun!)”
    
         She immediately starts waving me goodbye after our conversation so I begin walking down the path towards the glowing house, its glowing green, my favorite color. As I approach the door the sun is setting, I quickly go inside only to find a bed and a chest, from lack of finishing the game there isn’t much. I approach the chest as directed, and I know I must only choose two items to take along with me, but it’s been months since I wrote the game, and I don’t even remember what they do.
