    I decide to act big and tough hoping it’s a black bear coming my way, it’s dark enough that I can’t tell. I hear the footsteps approaching me and I prepare myself to attack. I breathe in and out heavily, in full panic. I hear something else behind me, I quickly turn my body around when the bear is in full sprint coming now at my back half. I get full-on pushed to the ground. As I lay on the ground, face first, I begin to gather all my strength to get up and re-approach this attack, but then before I know it, I’m being used as a chair. The bear is oddly light, so I think I can still work up enough strength to push this thing off me and be on the offensive side of this fight. I pick my body up, fling the bear off my back, and all of a sudden, I’m looking at the ass-hole of a bear. But this didn’t matter, the back halved only bear begins to run at me again. 

I need to make a decision quickly. This bear is not going to back down, and he still has his back paws to attack me. I begin running away, but he follows close behind. Just as I start to really panic, I see it. The box! Then I see another box. The closer I get to the boxes I can see a text bubble above them.

Choose wisely. One of these boxes gives you instructions on your next quest but the other seals your fate. You may only choose one box but think quickly, that bear’s ass is approaching fast.

The boxes are identical. I have no idea which one to choose. I have a CD in my inventory and half a bear chasing me, I can only imagine how much worse this can get.
